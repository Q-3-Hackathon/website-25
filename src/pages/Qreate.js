      <h1>Q<sup>3</sup> Initiative<br/>QREATE @ UMD</h1>
      <p>September 12 - 14, 2025 | University of Maryland, College Park in the STAMP Student Union</p>
      <p>At UMD, Q<sup>3</sup> will explore the intersection of quantum science and the arts. Through creative workshops, keynote talks by scientists and artists, exhibitions of quantum art, and virtual challenges, the program aims to make complex quantum concepts more accessible to the public. Our goal is to create an open, growing collection of educational quantum materials and to foster a community of students skilled in communicating complex scientific ideas to diverse audiencesâ€”making quantum science accessible to all.</p>
