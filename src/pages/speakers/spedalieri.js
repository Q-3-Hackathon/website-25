        <h2>Managing Director of the USC Quantum Initiative</h2>
        <p>Federico Spedalieri is the managing director of the quantum initiative at USC. His research involves the theory and practice of quantum annealers, especially understanding their quantum capabilities. More specifically, how quantum annealers can be used for specific applications like machine learning and circuit fault diagnosis. In the past, Dr. Spedalieri has also worked on entanglement characterization and entanglement detecting for the D-Wave quantum computer, USCâ€™s very-own. Ultimately his goal is to understand the ultimate limits that quantum mechanics impose on parameter estimation, in order to eventually acknowledge what applications could benefit from this kind of approach.</p>
